# Electromechanical-Engine-Gimbal-Control-System
An introductory study to Electromechanical Engine Gimbal Control systems using Matlab and simulink
Part 1:Design of (proportional + rate feedback), (Proportional + rate feedback  +  Integral) and (Proportional + Integral + Derivative) type of compensators for a typical electromechanical engine gimbal control system of launch vehicles and linear system performance assessment using SIMULINK model and SIMULINK LTI Viewer.
Part 2:a)Understand the effect of nonlinear elements like coulomb friction and speed torque limits of motor on the step response and frequency response of electromechanical EGC system.
       b)Disturbance response of closed loop EGC system for different values of integral controller gains.
